description: Prompt to develop a Technology Brief document
mode: agent
---

We will develop a technical document which represents the Technology Brief for this project.

You must ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough Technology Brief document for this project in the end. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed document that can be used by developers, AI agents, architects, and any other team members to understand the technical foundations, frameworks, libraries, development tools, and technical constraints of the project.

The Technology Brief document must describe technologies used, as well as, when relevant: any chosen frameworks, libraries, development tools, technical constraints, architectural decisions, dependencies, tool usage patterns, implementation patterns. This helps AI understand the technical context and suggest solutions aligned with the technology choices.

Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant technical detail. Remember, ask me only one question at a time.

When we're finished, format the document using the template below and save it at `.devspecs/memory/tech.md`. Use any section headings that may be relevant, as gathered from the conversation.

Here's the template:

```md

# Technology Brief: [PRODUCT NAME]

```

Now let's start.

Read the original product brief and ask me the first question.
