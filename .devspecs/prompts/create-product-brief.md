description: Prompt to develop a Product Brief document
mode: agent

We will develop a business document which represents the Product Brief for an idea.

You must ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough Product Brief document for this idea in the end. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed document than can be used by business executives, AI agents, developers, and any other team members to understand the product's purpose and the development scope.

At a high level, the Product Brief must include information about why the project exists, the problems it solves, and how it should work for its users.

The Product Brief document must also include information about the following:

- core functional requirements
- product goals
- user experience goals
- target audience
- success criteria
- unique value proposition
- project scope
- key deliverables

Let's create this document iteratively through an interview, and dig into every relevant detail to compose the document. Remember, ask me only one question at a time.

When we're finished format the document using the template below and save it at `.devspecs/memory/product.md`. Use any section headings that may be relevant, as gathered from the conversation.

Here's the template:

```md
---
applyTo: "**/*"

# Product Brief: [PRODUCT NAME]

```

Now let's start.

Here's the idea:
