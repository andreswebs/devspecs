# Product Brief

## Purpose

devspecs is an AI Spec-Driven Development framework designed specifically for GitHub Copilot users. It addresses the need to easily bootstrap a spec-driven development workflow in projects and standardize prompts, scripts, and directory structure. The framework provides a systematic approach to transform high-level ideas into detailed implementation plans with clear tracking and accountability.

## Target Users

devspecs is designed for any developer using AI assistants, specifically GitHub Copilot, including:

- Individual developers working on personal projects
- Development teams in startups and small companies
- Enterprise development teams
- Open source project maintainers

The framework targets developers who want a structured, repeatable approach to spec-driven development without the complexity of larger enterprise solutions.

## Key Features

### Core Framework Components

- **Bash-based implementation** with solid testing infrastructure using BATS (Bash Automated Testing System)
- **Standardized directory structure** for organizing specifications and project artifacts
- **One-command bootstrap** process for rapid project initialization
- **Curated prompt library** for consistent specification creation

### Streamlined Workflow

- **Single-command installation** via curl one-liner script
- **Guided document creation** using structured prompts for product overview and technology documentation
- **Feature-based specification workflow** with numbered feature branches (e.g., `001-feature-name`)
- **Three-document spec structure** per feature:
  - `requirements.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria
  - `plan.md` - Implementation planning
  - `tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown

### GitHub Integration

- **GitHub Copilot optimization** with framework designed specifically for Copilot workflows
- **Optional GitHub issue creation** with automatic assignment to Copilot
- **Git-based feature branch management** following structured naming conventions

## Business Objectives

### Primary Objective

Provide a well-documented, tested framework that demonstrates a preferred approach to spec-driven development, emphasizing:

- **Development speed and efficiency** through standardized workflows
- **Rapid project initialization** eliminating setup friction
- **Clear development flow** from specification to feature completion

### Secondary Objectives

- **Demonstrate best practices** for spec-driven development with AI assistants
- **Provide reference implementation** that others can study and adapt
- **Maintain high code quality** through comprehensive testing and documentation
- **Enable consistent project structure** across multiple development initiatives

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Support

- **Operating Systems**: macOS and Linux (Windows explicitly not supported)
- **Shell Requirements**: Bash 5 or higher
- **Dependencies**: Git, GitHub Copilot
- **Testing Framework**: BATS (Bash Automated Testing System)

### Integration Requirements

- **GitHub Copilot**: Designed specifically for GitHub Copilot workflows
- **Git Integration**: Feature branch management and version control
- **No cross-platform ambitions**: Focused on Unix-like environments only

## Success Metrics

Success for devspecs is defined as:

- **Personal productivity enhancement** through streamlined workflow adoption
- **Framework reliability** demonstrated through comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation quality** enabling easy understanding and adoption
- **Reference value** as a demonstration of spec-driven development principles
- **Community utility** for developers seeking similar workflow approaches

## Framework Philosophy

devspecs embodies a pragmatic approach to spec-driven development that prioritizes:

- **Simplicity over complexity** - Bash implementation for universal Unix compatibility
- **Structure over chaos** - Standardized directory layouts and naming conventions
- **Testing over assumptions** - Comprehensive test coverage for all framework components
- **Documentation over discovery** - Clear, accessible documentation for all processes
- **Focus over feature creep** - Deliberately limited scope with clear non-goals
